        \nWelcome to the rules for <b>Chalice</b>!\n\nThis
        game plays just like Hearts, but the Suits were swapped
        for traditional Tarot card suits.\n\n<b>
        Hearts\t\t\t --->  Cups\n
        Spades\t\t --->  Swords\n
        Clubs\t\t\t --->  Coins\n
        Diamonds  --->  Wands\n\nScoring:\n</b>Points are accrued by either
        picking up a card with a suit of Hearts,
        or picking up the Queen of Swords. Each <b>Heart</b> is worth <b>ONE</b> point,
        while the <b>Queen of Swords is worth 13 points</b>. When a player takes all 26
        points in a round, they "Shoot the Moon" which means all <b>other</b> players
        get 26 points added to their score, and the player who shot the moon gets none.
        \n\nWhichever player has the lowest score wins and games go on until a player
        hits either 50 or 100 points​ (chosen by user).
        Chalice is played in hands which are played in tricks of four cards each​.
        Tricks are won based whichever card has the highest value of the first suit lead.
